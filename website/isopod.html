        <p id="Information">Ever since the ocean reclaimed the land, the Isopod population skyrocketed.
            After numerous tests done by ProVision, it was concluded that this Tier 2 protein tastes best when boiled in burgundy colored water.
            This tricks your brain into tasting beef when in reality it's just the remains of a crustacean. When it comes to getting a variety nutrients in your diet, they are by far the best choice (even over beef). 
            Their vertebraes are packed with heavy metals and lined with a thin layer of protein rich, hearty white meat- a perfectly balanced deliacy. With recent developments in Isopod
            farming technology, ProVision has been able to streamline the process. They feed on animal remains and feces, so once the weekly deposit is made to The Pit,
            the Isopods are released from their respective sectors in waves. They devour the remains until they become slow and fat, then they are harpooned by our harvesting team and processed to be consumed.
            It's a perfectly harmonious cycle where nothing is put to waste and promotes a resourceful and waste-free society.
